**AIM:** 

The principle focus of our project is to perform data analysis and train a model using the most popular Machine Learning algorithm –Random forest in order to analyse the historical data that is present regarding price prediction of flight tickets by analysing the optimal features.

**ABSTRACT:**

Someone who purchase flight tickets frequently would be able to predict the right time to procure a ticket to obtain the best deal. Many airlines change ticket prices for their revenue management. The airline may increase the prices when the demand is to be expected to increase the capacity. To estimate the minimum airfare, data for a specific air route has been collected including the features like departure time, arrival time and airways over a specific period. Features are extracted from the collected data to apply Data Modelling technique – Random forest Algorithm. 

**INTRODUCTION:**

The flight ticket buying system is to purchase a ticket many days prior to flight takeoff so as to stay away from the effect of the most extreme charge. Mostly, aviation routes don’t agree this procedure. Plane organizations may diminish the cost at the time, they need to build the market and at the time when the tickets are less accessible. They may maximize the costs. So, the cost may rely upon different factors. To foresee the costs this venture uses AI to exhibit the ways of flight tickets after some time. All organizations have the privilege and opportunity to change its ticket costs at any time. Explorer can set aside cash by booking a ticket at the least costs. People who had travelled by flight frequently are aware of price fluctuations. The airlines use complex policies of Revenue Management for execution of distinctive evaluating systems. The evaluating system as a result changes the charge depending on time, season, and festive days to change the header or footer on successive pages. The ultimate aim of the airways is to earn profit whereas the customer searches for the minimum rate. Customers usually try to buy the ticket well in advance of departure date so as to avoid hike in airfare as date comes closer. But actually, this is not the fact. The customer may wind up by giving more than they ought to for the same seat. 
 
**DATASET:** 

The dataset we have considered, has information of different airlines with informative features of a flight that determine the prices of the air tickets effectively. This phase is very important since it defines the problem under solving. 
Original format of the dataset: XLSX 
A brief explanation of every column in the dataset is as follows: 

➢ 	Out Date – The date of the journey

➢	Out-Time – The timestamp at which journey commences from the source

➢	Out-Cities – The source from which the service begins.

➢	Out-Airline – The type of airline chosen for the journey

➢	Return-Date– Date of return journey

➢	Return Time-The timestamp at which journey starts for return journey type.

➢	Return Cities – The destination from which the service/journey begins

➢	Return Airline- The type of airline chosen for return journey.

➢	Out travel time- Time taken to reach from source to destination.

➢	Return travel time- Time taken to reach from destination to source

➢	Out Journey Type- One stop or non- stop.

➢	Return Journey Type- One stop or non-stop

➢	Out Stop Cities- intermediate cities for one-stop type journey

➢	Return Stop Cities- intermediate cities for return one-stop type journey

➢	Timestamp-time stamp of the particular journey

➢	Sort¬- best or cheap

➢	Price – The price of the ticket.
